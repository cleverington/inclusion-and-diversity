### Review from last meeting:
- possibility of introducing a ‘big sibling’ (name tbd) sort of program at camps and cons: someone who can introduce you to people, and include you in various things
- the idea of pushing underrepresented individuals to the front of group photos so they are more visible
- need for more education about why d&i is important in the first place



### Topics of the day:
- _dasjo_ Diversity talk at Dev Days Milan: http://milan2016.drupaldays.org/node/145
- _dasjo_ Diversity in European communities
- _rubyji_ One of things I have been seeing a lot that I think is relevant to our work here, is that people think of discrimination as something individuals do. They think “I don’t hate anyone, I’m not racist/sexist.” But we struggle to see how racism and sexism are built into our ​*systems*​ so that they perpetuate themselves without anyone needing to be a racist.  
I thought this was a great example of how this happens: http://www.bnd.com/news/nation-world/national/article89562297.html
- _drnikki_ can we give out swag to people for listening to a systemic inequalities talk? (modeled on Pantheon's sales presentations in vendor areas)

### Action Items
- _rubyji_ compile list of resources/educational things and add to repo
- _drnikki_ put these meeting notes into the repo.
