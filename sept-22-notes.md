# Topics
- how can white people support POC in spaces in which they are the only POC?
- how can the working group encourage people to question and examine their privilege, especially in technical spaces?
- how do we help people recognize their privilege without alienating them?

@bradleyfields "but just like you wouldn’t write a letter to a blind person and expect them to be able to read it…
we have to learn how people with certain kinds of privilege approach and evaluate what matters to them"
