# Topics of Discussion
- Using Recourse Center's safety rules as specific action items in addition to a general code of conduct.
  - no feigning surprise

- People could use training on how to interact with large groups of people in a more equitable way.

- As opposed to within activist communities, it can be frustrating to talk about diversity and inclusion when there is no shared literature base among the participants.

- If you don't see yourself represented, how do you know you can participate? This is an especially relevant question when picking session speakers and recruiting sprint mentors.

- separating privilege and comfort / vs systemic stuff
  - No one likes to have their privilege thrown at them

- How do we give critical feedback and help people accept it and want to move forward?
  - do we need to give feedback with the same specificity with which we'd write a bug report/no generalities

- Encourage people to make better mistakes tomorrow, or at least different mistakes

- Struggling with ow to be a good ally but feeling like personal experience doesn't qualify you.
- ex: A white individual wants to discuss diversity, but feels like it's not appropriate because of their whiteness.

# Take aways
- Generally, we want to keep the conversation going
- Most people all listen to podcasts - should we have a diversity podcasts, with diversity success stories? Does this already exist?
  - Benefit: when listening you hear more nuance and can pick up more and its often more accessible than reading.
- Start a camp-level diversity initiative template that camps can use and try to start one at the DA level at the same time.

# Next steps
- Literally continuing the conversation: Tuesday May 17 from 6 - 8 PST in IRC's #drupal-diversity channel.
