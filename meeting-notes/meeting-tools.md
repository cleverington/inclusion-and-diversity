### History:
@drnikki & @techgirlgeek gave a presentation about diversity and inclusion at DrupalCon New Orleans. A follow up BOF was held the next day.  Participants had so many ideas, and concerns and desires that we couldn’t do justice to most of them in the short amount of time we had.  The general consensus seemed to be “Let’s keep talking about this so we can address everyone’s thoughts.”

### Purpose:
To continue the conversation about diversity and inclusion within Drupal. This includes:
- To provide a safe space to discuss issues of d&i within the Drupal community.
- To provide support for people who are marginalized in technology
- To provide strategies for increasing d&i of communities and organizations
- To share resources/education about social justice issues in our technological communities - d&i, equality, inclusion, accessibility, etc.

### Every-meeting agenda:
- purpose review
- status update from last time
- open discussion/call for topics
- [topics of the day]
