- how to address a "thanks, gents" or "thanks, men" comment when
- what can we do when we see this happening? Should we speak up for an incident in which we're not immediately involved?

@bradleyfields
generally, i’m ok with someone playing the role of ally or advocate
but it feels better when the communication is about the words used, behavior shown
and _not_ explicitly about defending _me_
also (and i know i'm sometimes guilty of it too) making it about “rescue” can just further diminish someone’s stature and now make the story about You the Hero

- addressing things as they come up is generally helpful

@drnikki
Okay, so it sounds like strategy 1: say something and focus on language, not on any of the individuals involved in the conversation.

@rubyji
- There are a lot of people contributing here and not all of them are [gents/whatever]

@bradleyfields: shorter responses are better
1. fact: some version of @rubyji’s “not all contributors are gents”
2. only if the situation escalates, then get into why we’re having that conversation (e.g., importance of language)

 So, it sounds like strategy 2: If you choose to say something, make it short and fact-based and save any motivation/purpose talk (importance of language, inclusion, etc) for followups
@rubyji
Save the second step for if it there is pushback or the conversation seems like it would be productive.


it sounds like your question is a corollary to the conversation we’re having - how to deal with people in a text-based medium when tone and intention are difficult to determine
