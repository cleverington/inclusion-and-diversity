https://github.com/drnikki/inclusion-and-diversity/wiki/Educational-resources
- _thenyoudi_ looking into d/i meetups in Dublin

# Action Items for This Meeting
Reviewing the resource list.
- _techgirlgeek_ What about something regarding how to nip the bias in the bud starting earlier, like in middle-school? I don’t see anything about that, unless I’m missing it somewhere.


# Discussion Points
_@bradleyfields_:

    i think i’m noticing 3 possible distinct initiatives with all the notes, ideas, etc. gathered so far:
    1. changing minds (the “i only hire based on merit” stories)
    2. welcoming underrepresented people
    3. encouraging/enabling/giving tools to, etc. people who want to be accomplices, but don’t know how/where/whether to start (edited)
    and so
    a. is that a fair characterization?
    b. should we prioritize one over any other?
    c. do we need to segment our work accordingly? (e.g., a “changing minds” group within this d+i set)


# Followup for next meeting:
- figure out where we want to put our energy, and let that be guided by what people are most passionate about.
- continue to work on https://github.com/drnikki/inclusion-and-diversity/wiki/Educational-resources
