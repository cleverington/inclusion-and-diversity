### Review from last meeting:
- possibility of introducing a ‘big sibling’ (name tbd) sort of program at camps and cons: someone who can introduce you to people, and include you in various things
- the idea of pushing underrepresented individuals to the front of group photos so they are more visible
- need for more education about why d&i is important in the first place


### Topics of the day:
- _monicadear_
if there is a set of best practices that we could disseminate and share within the Drupal community about diversity and inclusion. like a top 10 listicle about how to word job listings, how to add inclusive language into RFP’s, how to reach out to consultants or teams.
- _monicadear_ how to integrate into your organization ‘safe spaces’ and feedback loops to discuss current issues in the context of diversity and inclusion
- _thenyoudi_ I will be going to Dublin and was wondering if anyone has planned any or know of any meet ups re: d/i?
